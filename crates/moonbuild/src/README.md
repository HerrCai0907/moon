## Tests

### Running Tests

To run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Promoting New Test Results

If you have made changes to the code that cause test failures, you can use the following command to promote new test results:

```bash
env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test
```

This command will update the expected test results to match the actual results. Use this command with caution, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if used incorrectly.


## Generate `lexer.rs`
`lexer.rs` is generated by re2c 3.0 by using the following command:

```bash
re2rust ./lexer.re2c --tags --output lexer.rs
```
